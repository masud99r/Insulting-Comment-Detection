**Project Title - Detection of Insulting Comments in Online Discussion**

In this project, we aim to detect the comments that may appear insulting to other participants in an online discussion or conversation. We will use text processing techniques to generate features and then we will use supervised learning techniques to detect insulting vs non-insulting comments from the text. We are planning to use naive Bayes and logistic regression to set a baseline. After setting the baseline, we are aiming to use models like support vector machine, random forests. Finally we will use adaptive ensemble classifier to maximize accuracy. In order to avoid over-fitting, we will tune and evaluate our model via K-folds cross validation. The dataset is obtained from the popular data science competition portal, Kaggle.
